# ðŸŒŒ NEA Detection Dashboard for Lesedi 1-m Telescope

This project provides a **Streamlit-based dashboard** for visualizing and scoring Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) detections from the **Lesedi 1-m telescope at SAAO**.  
It integrates the full detection pipeline â€” from frame alignment to **hybrid CNN + Gradient Boosting** scoring â€” and outputs ranked asteroid candidates.

## Features

- Upload aligned triplet folders or ZIPs directly in the app.  
- Automatically runs the **hybrid CNN + GB** scoring pipeline.  
- Displays top-ranked candidate tracks with confidence scores.  
- Exports RA/Dec positions of the top-3 candidates for MPC submission.  
- Includes ready-made **sample ZIPs** for quick testing:
  - `sample.zip` â†’ **High-score** (good linking example)
  - `sample_2.zip` â†’ **Low-score** (low score linking example)
